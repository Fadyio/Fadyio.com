bio: 'Hey there! I’m Fady Nagh, a DevOps engineer who’s totally hooked on tech.
      I go as ‘Fadyio’ on most platforms, I love messing around with Linux, diving into cloud stuff,
      and just geeking out over IT in general. 
      When I’m not knee-deep in code or servers, you’ll catch me with a good book. 
      Here, I share a bit of everything, quick notes when I’m scribbling thoughts, 
      or detailed step-by-step guides when I’m feeling extra helpful. Got a question or just wanna chat? Hit me up through the contact form below, I’m always up for a good convo'
