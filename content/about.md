### Welcome to My home on the internet.

My name is Fady, I am a DevOps Engineer with a strong background in system administration. I have a passion for automating processes and improving the efficiency of software delivery.
I have experience working with a variety of technologies, including AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CircleCI, Prometheus.

In my spare time, I do pretty much the same things I do at work, plus I like to exercise free-body, run, read, listen to music.
