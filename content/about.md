### Welcome to My home on the internet.


Hey there! I'm Fady, I am a DevOps, SRE and Cloud Engineer with a strong background in system administration and infrastructure tooling. 

My expertise primarily revolves around Go, Python, Linux, Kubernetes, serverless architectures and the Cloud Native domain in general. I've always had a keen interest in system-level programming, and networking. At the moment, I am learning more about AI.

 I'm an active contributor to open source and believe in the importance of knowledge sharing, as evidenced by the [blog](/posts) that I run, which I occasionally post technical articles.
 
 Additionally, I hold the title of AWS Community Builder.


In my spare time, I do pretty much the same things I do at work, plus I like to exercise, cycling, buy more books than I read, play video games, listen to music.

My GPG key is published [Here](/pgp-key.txt), if you need a way to send me something securely.
